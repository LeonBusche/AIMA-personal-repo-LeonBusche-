        "## Welcome to the Medical AI Agent Challenge!\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
        "In this exercise, you will:\n",
        "1. Learn how to build **multi-agent systems** using CrewAI\n",
        "2. Understand how AI agents can collaborate to solve complex medical problems\n",
        "3. Create tools that allow agents to search databases and knowledge bases\n",
        "4. Define specialized agents with specific medical roles\n",
        "5. Orchestrate agent collaboration for medical diagnosis\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📖 The Scenario\n",
        "You are building an AI system to help diagnose a patient. The patient has symptoms, but **you don't know the diagnosis yet**. Your AI agents will:\n",
        "- Analyze medical reports (pathology, radiology, lab results)\n",
        "- Search a database of similar past patients\n",
        "- Look up medical knowledge bases and literature\n",
        "- Collaborate to make a diagnosis and treatment plan\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🩺 Medical Background (No Medical Knowledge Required!)\n",

        "\n",
        "**Medical Specialists:**\n",
        "- **Pathologist**: Examines tissue samples under a microscope to identify diseases\n",
        "- **Radiologist**: Interprets medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs)\n",
        "- **Laboratory Physician**: Analyzes blood tests and other lab results\n",
        "- **Oncologist**: Cancer specialist who diagnoses and treats cancer\n",
        "- **Treatment Coordinator**: Plans the overall treatment strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "**Medical Terms You'll See:**\n",
        "- **Pathology Report**: Description of how tissue looks under a microscope\n",
        "- **Radiology Report**: Description of what appears on medical scans\n",
        "- **Lab Results**: Blood test values (like hemoglobin, creatinine)\n",
        "- **Diagnosis**: Identifying what disease the patient has\n",
        "- **Treatment Plan**: The medical strategy to treat the disease\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🤖 What is CrewAI?\n",
        "**CrewAI** is a framework for building teams of AI agents that work together. Think of it like a company:\n",
        "- **Agents** = Employees with specific roles and skills\n",
        "- **Tools** = Resources agents use (like databases, search engines)\n",
        "- **Tasks** = Jobs that need to be done\n",
        "- **Crew** = The whole team working together\n",
        "\n",
        "Agents can:\n",
        "- Use tools to gather information\n",
        "- Complete specific tasks\n",
        "- Delegate work to other agents\n",
        "- Remember previous interactions\n",

        "- **Take your time**: AI agents can take several minutes to run\n",
        "- **Warnings are OK**: You may see warnings - they're usually harmless if the code still runs\n",
        "- **Errors happen**: If something breaks, check your API keys and syntax\n",

        "\n",
        "Now that you have a working system, try experimenting with:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Add More Tools 🛠️\n",
        "**Try adding searches for other medical websites:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example: Add WHO search\n",
        "who_search = SerperDevTool(\n",
        "    search_url=\"https://google.com/search?q=site:who.int+{query}\"\n",
        ")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: Add UpToDate search\n",
        "uptodate_search = SerperDevTool(\n",
        "    search_url=\"https://google.com/search?q=site:uptodate.com+{query}\"\n",
        ")\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Then add these tools to your agents!**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Modify Agents 🤖\n",
        "**Try experimenting with:**\n",
        "- Adding a new specialist (e.g., Genetics Counselor)\n",
        "- Removing an agent to see how results change\n",
        "- Changing `allow_delegation` to see collaboration patterns\n",
        "- Modifying backstories to change agent behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Change the Patient 👤\n",
        "**Create different medical scenarios:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example: Breast cancer patient\n",
        "example_patient = {\n",
        "    \"patient_id\": \"P-001\",\n",
        "    \"age\": 52,\n",
        "    \"gender\": \"Female\",\n",
        "    \"pathology_report\": \"Ductal carcinoma in situ with ER positive, PR positive, HER2 negative...\",\n",
        "    # Add more fields...\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Try Different LLMs 🧠\n",
        "If you have access to other LLM APIs, try changing the model:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "llm_config = {\n",
        "    \"model\": \"different-model-name\",\n",
        "    \"api_key\": \"your-key\",\n",
        "    \"base_url\": \"api-url\"\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Enable Parallel Processing ⚡\n",
        "**Try running some tasks in parallel instead of sequential:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "medical_crew = Crew(\n",
        "    agents=[...],\n",
        "    tasks=[...],\n",
        "    process=Process.hierarchical,  # Try hierarchical instead\n",

        ")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Change Task Dependencies 🔗\n",
        "**Try making tasks depend on specific outputs:**\n",
        "- What if the diagnosis task only uses pathology findings?\n",
        "- What if you add validation tasks?\n",
        "- What if you add a \"second opinion\" agent?\n",
