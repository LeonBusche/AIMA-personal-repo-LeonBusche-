        "**Time series forecasting** in the context of ECG involves predicting future segments of the signal based on its recent history. This can help estimate how the heart rhythm will evolve in the next few milliseconds or beats. Such forecasting is valuable for early detection of arrhythmias, anticipating signal anomalies, or supporting real-time monitoring systems that can alert clinicians to irregular patterns before they fully manifest. Because ECGs are highly periodic yet sensitive to small physiological changes, forecasting models must learn both short-term dependencies within individual beats and long-term variations across heart cycles.\n",

        "\n",
        "As explained in the lecture, **PatchTST (Patch Time Series Transformer)** is a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for long-term forecasting of (multivariate) time series. It has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance by introducing two key innovations to adapt the powerful Transformer model—originally popularized in Natural Language Processing—for time series data:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Patching (Segmentation of Time Series)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of treating individual time steps as input tokens (like words in a sentence, which is known as point-wise attention), PatchTST segments each time series into subseries-level \"patches\" (short, fixed-length segments).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These patches become the input tokens for the Transformer encoder. This is highly effective because:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   It retains local semantic information (patterns within the short patch).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   It significantly reduces computational complexity and memory usage, allowing the model to process much longer historical sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Channel-Independence**\n",
        "\n",
        "For multivariate time series (data with multiple features or \"channels,\" like temperature, wind speed, and humidity), PatchTST processes each individual time series (channel) independently using the same shared Transformer backbone and weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach simplifies the modeling of complex multi-channel data, improves training efficiency, and enhances the model's ability to generalize across different channels. The final predictions are then generated for each channel and combined.\n",
